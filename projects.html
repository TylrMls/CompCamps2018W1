      <h1 class="text">CampCoin Miner:</h1>
      <p class="text">The CampCoin miner works a lot like a bitcoin miner. it uses different numbers and equations to solve a problem it is given by the blockchain. I basically remade the program that does this, and tried to make it as efficient as possible.<br /> The miner I have created is very efficient for the first little while, but once its nonce gets high enough, it begins doing more work than it needs to, which is something I will need to fix later.</p>

      <h1 class="text">Website:</h1>
      <p class="text">This is the HTML code for the website that you are seeing now.<br /> Because this wasn't my main project, I didn't put nearly as much time into this site as I did into the CampCoin miner.</p>
