      <h1>CampCoin Miner:</h1>
      <p>The CampCoin miner works a lot like a bitcoin miner. it uses different numbers and equations to solve a problem it is given by the blockchain. I basically remade the program that does this, and tried to make it as efficient as possible.<br /> The miner I have created is very efficient for the first little while, but once its nonce gets high enough, it begins doing more work than it needs to, which is something I will need to fix later.</p>
